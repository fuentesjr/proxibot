Welcome to ProxiBot 

Introduction
================================================================================

ProxiBot is a Google App Engine web application. It is written in Python. This
is a fork of Nick Johnson's crowdguru. It is basically an XMPP bot that proxies 
commands to other web applications via a RESTful API/Service. Thus, as long as
an application implements the basic/required commands through a RESTful
interface, those same resources become accessible through XMPP via ProxiBot.
This ultimately allows an administrator/operator of multiple web applications
to monitor and query those applications via an xmpp client (e.g. google talk).
